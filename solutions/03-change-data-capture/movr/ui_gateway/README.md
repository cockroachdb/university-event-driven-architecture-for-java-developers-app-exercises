## Project Overview
This is the Java API backend implementation of the MovR ui_gateway application. 
The application demonstrates how to integrate a Java/Spring Boot 
implementation with other microservices. This application can run
standalone to provide a REST API, or in conjunction with a front
end implemented with React.js. 
However, this application requires the vehicles, rides, and users microservices to be running at the same time. Please see their individual README.md files.

## Requirements

You will need Java.

## Running the Application

To run the application you can execute the `run.sh` script.

```
./run.sh
```

This will compile the application with Maven, run the tests, and execute.
